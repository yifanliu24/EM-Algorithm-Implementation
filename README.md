Before running this program, ensure that the numpy and PIL packages are installed in your python interpreter.
If it is not, you may install them using the following commands from your command prompt:
python3 -m pip install matplotlib
python3 -m pip install str2bool

To run it change your directory to wherever you save the code and datasets

Then Type "python3 -m main <arg1> <arg2>" into your command prompt.
---<arg1> is the number of Gaussian models you have (e.g. {1,3,5}) and <arg2> is a boolean flag that determines if you show the plot.

Then you will see the result in the commad prompt. It will contain the parameters and the likelihood for step2 and step3
